        CLN REST is a protocol that allows mobile wallets to query payments and
	balances, generate invoices and make payments from accounts that exist
	on a server. The protocol is a collection of HTTP endpoints exposed
	through the internet.

        For a wallet that supports it, reading a QR code that contains the URL
        along with secret access credentials should enable access. Currently it
        is supported by <a class="text-secondary" href="https://zeusln.com">Zeus</a>.
